                Download mp4 file from Coursera in one go

Ponder:
    Make sure you open coursera in one tab and signed in before running the script
    Go to your coursera course, open video lecture, view page source, copy the entire
        content into input.html file and place it in the same folder as of source.py
        use input.html as in my case
    Use chrome although firefox will work but I have tested only in chrome
    Code written in half hour as I have to watch football match

   use html parser instead of re
   make sure to close tab (difficult)
   Direct sign in (difficult)
   modify readme file
